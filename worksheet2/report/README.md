## Using github Issues Feature to improve our code ##
* During our last meeting, where we discussed Worksheet 1, we actively took notes to thoroughly evaluate our work. We recognized the importance of refining our code and addressing specific areas of improvement. To streamline our collaboration and track the tasks efficiently, we utilized the GitHub issues feature. This approach allowed us to incorporate the valuable feedback we received, breaking down the feedback into smaller tasks that we could address.
